# Address Field Implementation

This document provides an overview of the extended address field implementation added to the EyeSentry platform.

## Overview

The address field implementation enhances the platform with more structured address data by:

1. Adding dedicated fields for street address, city, state, and ZIP code
2. Maintaining backward compatibility with the existing address field
3. Updating the UI to provide a more user-friendly address entry experience
4. Ensuring database schema changes are applied safely

## Database Changes

The following columns have been added to the `profiles` table:

- `street_address` (TEXT): The street address (e.g., "123 Main St")
- `city` (TEXT): The city name
- `state` (TEXT): The state or province
- `zip_code` (TEXT): The ZIP or postal code

The original `address` column is maintained for backward compatibility and is automatically populated with a formatted string combining the new address fields.

## Migration

The migration to add these fields is available in `supabase/add_address_fields.sql`. This migration:

1. Safely adds the new columns if they don't already exist
2. Updates the RLS policies to include the new fields
3. Updates relevant views to include the new fields
4. Attempts to parse existing address data into the new fields if possible

## UI Updates

The user profile page has been updated to include dedicated fields for each address component:

- Street Address input
- City and State inputs as a 2-column layout
- ZIP Code input with appropriate width and validation
  
This provides a more structured and user-friendly way for users to enter address information.

## Implementation Details

### Form Changes

The user profile form now collects each address component separately and combines them to create a formatted address string.

### Data Flow

1. When users enter address information, each component is stored separately
2. During profile updates, the system combines these components into a formatted address string
3. Both the individual components and the formatted address are stored in the database
4. When displaying address information, the app can choose to show the formatted address or the individual components based on the context

### Doctor Approvals

The Doctor Approvals interface has been updated to display the complete address information, showing street address, city, state, and ZIP code in a structured format.

## Benefits

- **Improved Data Quality**: Structured address data enables better searching, filtering, and geographical analysis
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Dedicated fields provide clear guidance for address entry
- **Better Validation**: Each address component can be validated separately
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with the formatted address field

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Address validation using external APIs
- Geocoding to convert addresses to geographic coordinates
- Enhanced search/filter capabilities based on location data
- Maps integration to visualize doctor locations
