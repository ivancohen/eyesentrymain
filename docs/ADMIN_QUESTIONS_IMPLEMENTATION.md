# Admin Question Management Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. Fixes the database schema mismatch error: "column questions.question_text does not exist"
2. Integrates question management into the admin panel
3. Adds page categorization for organizing questions by questionnaire page
4. Restricts question management to admin users only

## Components Added/Modified

1. **EnhancedQuestionManager Component**
   - Created a new component that combines both:
     - Question creation/editing functionality
     - Question scoring management
   - Located in `src/components/admin/EnhancedQuestionManager.tsx`

2. **Admin Integration**
   - Updated `src/pages/Admin.tsx` and `src/pages/NewAdmin.tsx` to use the new component

3. **Database Schema**
   - Added SQL for adding the `page_category` column to the questions table
   - Created SQL function to manage schema changes safely

4. **Utility Scripts**
   - Created `src/utils/add-sample-categorized-questions.js` to add example categorized questions
   - Added auth diagnostics tool in `src/utils/auth-diagnostics.js` to help with auth issues

## Documentation

Complete documentation has been added:
- `docs/QUESTION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Admin-focused guide for managing questions
- `docs/SCHEMA_STANDARDS.md` - Standards for database field naming
- `docs/ADDING_QUESTIONS.md` - Step-by-step instructions for adding questions

## Authentication Issues

The authentication errors encountered (`message channel closed before a response was received`) are likely related to:

1. **Supabase Auth Communication**
   - The error suggests communication with the Supabase authentication service is being interrupted
   - This typically happens when browser security settings block cross-origin requests or third-party cookies

2. **Potential Solutions**:
   - **Run in development mode**: `npm run dev` instead of using a production build
   - **Use Chrome**: Supabase auth has better compatibility with Chrome
   - **Disable extensions**: Privacy extensions can interfere with auth flows
   - **Clear browser storage**: Clear local storage, cookies, and session storage
   - **Check network tab**: Look for blocked requests in the browser console

3. **Diagnostics Tool**
   - We've added `src/utils/auth-diagnostics.js` to help diagnose auth issues
   - Run it in the browser console to get detailed information about the auth state
   - It will check for common issues that could be causing the problem

## Using the Question Management Features

Despite the authentication warning messages, the question management functionality should work once you're logged in as an admin user. You can:

1. Navigate to the Admin section
2. Go to the Question Management tab 
3. Add, edit, or manage question scores
4. Assign questions to specific pages in the questionnaire

## Next Steps

If authentication issues persist:
1. Run the diagnostics script in your browser console
2. Check your Supabase authentication configuration
3. Consider implementing a more robust auth state recovery mechanism
