# Authentication Issues & Fixes

## Reported Issues

The following console errors have been observed:
```
NewAdmin.tsx:71 Admin page: Auth state check Object
NewAdmin.tsx:80 Admin page: Authentication is still loading
AuthContext.tsx:146 Initial auth check
```

## Root Causes

These issues can result from several potential problems:

1. **Authentication getting stuck in loading state**
   - The Supabase auth callbacks may not be completing properly
   - This can occur due to browser extensions blocking authentication flows
   - Network issues may prevent authentication checks from completing

2. **Admin permission detection issues**
   - Supabase profiles table may not correctly indicate admin status
   - The auth state may not reflect the actual admin privileges

3. **Browser or localStorage issues**
   - Privacy settings/extensions may block localStorage access
   - Authentication tokens may be expired or corrupted

## Implemented Fixes

We've implemented several fixes and improvements to address these issues:

### 1. Auth Diagnostics Utility

A new diagnostics utility has been added at `src/utils/auth-diagnostics.js` that you can run in your browser console to help diagnose authentication issues. It checks:

- Supabase session data in localStorage
- Current user session validity
- Admin privilege indicators
- Suggests remediation steps

### 2. Enhanced Loading State

The admin page has been updated to handle authentication loading more gracefully:

- Added a timeout to detect when authentication takes too long
- Provides self-help UI for users to recover from stuck authentication
- Added buttons to refresh the page or clear authentication and try again

### 3. Improved Authentication Context

The auth context now:

- Checks multiple sources to confirm admin status
- Has improved error handling
- Better redirects users based on their role

## How to Resolve Continued Issues

If you continue to experience authentication issues:

1. **Run the auth diagnostics tool**
   Open your browser console and execute:
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = '/src/utils/auth-diagnostics.js';
   document.body.appendChild(script);
   ```

2. **Clear authentication and login again**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   window.location.href = '/login';
   ```

3. **Check browser extensions**
   Try in incognito mode or disable browser extensions that might interfere with authentication

4. **Check for database issues**
   Run the following SQL to check and fix permissions issues:
   ```sql
   supabase/clean_fix_permissions.sql
   ```

## Questions Standardization

Additionally, we've standardized the question fields in the database to fix related errors:

1. **Fixed the "Error fetching question scores: column questions.question_text does not exist"**
   - Created `supabase/standardize_question_field.sql` to normalize question fields
   - The script handles reconciling `question_text` and `question` columns
   - Added page category for better organization

2. **Run the standardization script**
   ```sql
   supabase/standardize_question_field.sql
   ```

3. **Import questionnaire questions**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/utils/import-questionnaire-questions.js
   ```

## Long-term Solutions

For long-term stability:

1. **Consistent field naming convention**
   - See `docs/SCHEMA_STANDARDS.md` for naming conventions to follow
   - Use PRs with mandatory reviews for schema changes

2. **Authentication resilience**
   - Multiple fallback methods for admin detection
   - Clear recovery paths for authentication issues
   - Improved user feedback during auth processes
