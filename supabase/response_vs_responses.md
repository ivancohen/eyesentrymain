# Important Note About Column Names

Based on the SQL error feedback, I've identified that the column in the `patient_responses` table is named `response` (singular) rather than `responses` (plural) as we originally assumed.

The error was:
```
ERROR: 42703: column "responses" does not exist
LINE 70: responses->>'age' as age,
         ^
HINT: Perhaps you meant to reference the column "patient_responses.response".
```

I've fixed this in:

1. The SQL view creation script (`fix_permissions_immediately.sql`) - now using `response->>'age'` etc.

2. Our `AdminService.ts` code should work with the view we created (the view converts the data to the correct format).

## Database Schema Note

For future reference, the correct schema appears to be:

```
patient_responses
- id: UUID
- created_at: timestamp
- response: JSONB (this is a single JSON object with all response fields)
- risk_level: string
- total_score: number
- user_id: UUID
```

This is different from what we initially assumed:
```
patient_responses
- id: UUID
- created_at: timestamp
- responses: JSONB ‚Üê This is the incorrect name
- risk_level: string
- total_score: number
- user_id: UUID
```

The SQL view we created properly maps this to the frontend data structure our application expects.
