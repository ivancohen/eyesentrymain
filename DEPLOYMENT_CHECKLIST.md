# Deployment Checklist for Cloudflare Pages

This checklist provides a comprehensive list of steps to successfully deploy the EyeSentry application to Cloudflare Pages, addressing all identified issues.

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- [ ] Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Ensure you have npm 8+ installed
- [ ] Install Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`
- [ ] Log in to Cloudflare: `npx wrangler login`

### 2. Project Preparation

- [ ] Verify `wrangler.toml` configuration
- [ ] Create or update `.env` file with required variables
- [ ] Clean previous build artifacts: `rm -rf dist`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`

### 3. Fix TypeScript Errors

- [ ] Run `fix-verify-questions.bat/sh` to fix JavaScript files with TypeScript syntax
- [ ] Check for any other .js files with TypeScript code using search tools
- [ ] If needed, run `generate-lenient-tsconfig.bat/sh` to create lenient TypeScript configuration

## Build Process

### 4. Modified Build Strategy

- [ ] Back up configuration files:
  - [ ] tsconfig.json
  - [ ] vite.config.ts
  - [ ] package.json
- [ ] Create production-optimized configurations:
  - [ ] Modify tsconfig.json to disable strict type checking
  - [ ] Modify vite.config.ts to skip type checking during build
  - [ ] Modify package.json build script if needed
- [ ] Execute direct build:
  - [ ] Run `npm run build` or direct build script
  - [ ] Verify the dist directory is created successfully
- [ ] Restore original configuration files

### 5. Build Output Verification

- [ ] Verify `dist` directory exists and contains:
  - [ ] index.html
  - [ ] assets directory with CSS/JS files
  - [ ] All required static assets
- [ ] Ensure the build output is complete and valid

## Deployment Process

### 6. Cloudflare Deployment

#### Option 1: Using Wrangler CLI (Recommended)

- [ ] Ensure you're logged in: `npx wrangler whoami`
- [ ] Deploy using Wrangler:
  ```bash
  npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name eyesentry
  ```
- [ ] Note the deployment URL provided by Wrangler

#### Option 2: Manual Upload (Fallback)

- [ ] Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
- [ ] Go to Pages section
- [ ] Select or create "eyesentry" project
- [ ] Click "Upload" or "Deploy site"
- [ ] Upload the dist directory
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### 7. Post-Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Set up environment variables in Cloudflare Dashboard
- [ ] Configure custom domain if needed
- [ ] Set up any required redirects or headers
- [ ] Configure caching rules if needed

## Deployment Verification

### 8. Testing Deployed Application

- [ ] Access the deployment URL
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Check for console errors in browser developer tools
- [ ] Verify API connections are working
- [ ] Test core functionality:
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Questionnaire submission
  - [ ] Data retrieval
  - [ ] Admin features (if applicable)

### 9. Error Handling

- [ ] If deployment fails, check Cloudflare logs
- [ ] Review build output for errors
- [ ] Check browser console for runtime errors
- [ ] Verify network requests are working as expected

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Failures

- TypeScript errors: Use lenient TypeScript configuration
- Missing dependencies: Run `npm install`
- Environmental issues: Create proper .env file
- Memory issues: Increase Node memory limit

#### Deployment Failures

- Authentication issues: Re-login to Cloudflare
- Permission issues: Verify account access levels
- Project configuration: Ensure project exists and is configured
- Size limitations: Check if build output is too large

#### Runtime Issues

- Missing assets: Verify all assets are included in build
- API connectivity: Check API endpoints and credentials
- Browser compatibility: Test in different browsers
- Performance issues: Check for performance bottlenecks

## Long-Term Maintenance

### 10. Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Document any remaining issues for future fixes
- [ ] Plan for proper TypeScript integration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- [ ] Schedule regular code maintenance to prevent future issues

## Deployment Sign-Off

- [ ] All critical functionality works as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No blocking errors in console
- [ ] User experience is satisfactory
- [ ] Deployment is complete and stable
