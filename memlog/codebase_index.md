# EyeSentry Codebase Index

## Project Overview
EyeSentry is a healthcare application with functionality for patients, doctors, specialists, and administrators. Built using React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## TypeScript Error Analysis

After running the TypeScript compiler, we detected 99 errors in 41 files. The errors fall into these categories:

1. **Unused Imports and Variables (75%)**: Most errors are unused imports or variables that don't affect functionality but need cleanup.

2. **Type Conversion Issues (9%)**: These are critical errors in the AIAssistantService where type conversions are potentially unsafe:
   - 5 instances of unsafe type conversions in `src/services/AIAssistantService.ts`
   - 1 issue with SpeechRecognition in `src/components/admin/AIAssistant.tsx`

3. **Interface and Type Definition Issues (16%)**: Declarations that are defined but never used.

## Critical Files Requiring Fixes

1. `src/services/AIAssistantService.ts`: Contains unsafe type assertions and conversions
2. `src/components/admin/AIAssistant.tsx`: Has SpeechRecognition API usage issues
3. `src/app/risk-assessment/page.tsx`: Contains syntax error in import statement

## Fix Strategy

1. Fix critical type conversion issues first, as they can cause runtime errors
2. Clean up unused imports and variables for better maintainability 
3. Address interface and type definition issues

Using sequential reasoning, we'll tackle the errors in order of severity and impact on application functionality.
