# TypeScript Error Fixes

## Summary of Issues

After analyzing the TypeScript errors, I've identified the following critical issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Syntax Error in Import Statement**
   - File: `src/app/risk-assessment/page.tsx`
   - Line 3: `import React { useEffect useState } from 'react';`
   - Problem: Missing comma between `useEffect` and `useState`

2. **Potential Undefined Access in Speech Recognition**
   - File: `src/components/admin/AIAssistant.tsx`
   - Line 88: `recognitionRef.current = new SpeechRecognitionConstructor();`
   - Problem: `SpeechRecognitionConstructor` may be undefined, needs a type check

3. **Unsafe Type Assertions in AIAssistantService**
   - File: `src/services/AIAssistantService.ts`
   - Lines 366, 398: Direct type assertions from `Record<string, unknown>[]` to specific types
   - Lines 610, 612, 614, 616, 618: Unsafe type conversions in the `processData` method
   - Problem: Type assertions don't perform runtime checks, potential runtime errors

## Fix Strategy

I'll implement fixes in the following order:

1. First, fix the syntax error in the import statement
2. Next, fix the speech recognition issue with proper type checking
3. Finally, address the type assertion issues in the AIAssistantService with proper type guards

Each fix will be documented with before/after code snippets for clarity.
