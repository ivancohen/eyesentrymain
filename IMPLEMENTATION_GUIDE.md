# EyeSentry Implementation Guide

This guide provides steps to implement the enhanced functionality in the EyeSentry application, including doctor approvals, question ordering, and improved admin dashboard. Phone number fields have been removed from the system as per requirements.

## Database Updates

First, run the SQL scripts to update your database schema and functions:

1. **Basic Schema Enhancements:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to your Supabase database and run:
   psql -f supabase/ultra_simple_admin.sql
   ```

   This will:
   - Add geographic fields to the profiles table (location, state, zip_code)
   - Add specialty field for doctor specialization
   - Add doctor_id to patient_responses for linking patients with doctors
   - Add display_order field to questions for proper ordering
   - Create admin views for better data access
   - Create database functions for managing doctor approvals
   - Remove phone_number field from the database schema

2. **Role-Switch-Free Authentication Fix:**
   ```bash
   # Then run the no-role-switch fix:
   psql -f supabase/no_role_switch_fix.sql
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a check_is_admin() function that verifies admin status directly
   - Create admin views that use this function instead of role switching
   - Grant appropriate permissions for authenticated users

## New Components

The following new components have been added:

1. **Doctor Approval Workflow**
   - `DoctorApprovals.tsx`: Manages pending doctor approval requests
   - Allows admins to approve or reject doctor registrations

2. **Doctor Office Management**
   - `DoctorOfficeManagement.tsx`: Manages doctor office information
   - Includes filtering by location and specialty
   - Supports editing and deleting doctor accounts

3. **Question Order Management**
   - `QuestionOrderManager.tsx`: Manages the order of questions across categories
   - Allows reordering questions within a category
   - Supports moving questions between categories

4. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard**
   - `NewAdmin.tsx`: New admin dashboard with tabbed interface
   - Integrates all administrative functions in one place

## Service Layer Updates

The following service files have been updated:

1. **QuestionService.ts**
   - Added question ordering functions (moveQuestionUp, moveQuestionDown)
   - Added category management (moveQuestionToCategory)
   - Updated the Question interface with display_order field
   - Implemented complete ordering system for questions across categories

2. **FixedAdminService.ts**
   - Added doctor management functions (fetchDoctorOffices, updateDoctorOffice, deleteDoctor)
   - Added doctor approval functions (fetchPendingDoctorApprovals, approveDoctor, rejectDoctor)
   - Added geographic data functions (getUniqueLocations)

## Accessing the New Admin Interface

After implementing the updates, you can access the new admin interface at:

```
/new-admin
```

Make sure to update your routing to include this new page. The new interface provides:

- User management with enhanced controls
- Doctor approval workflow
- Doctor office management
- Geographic patient data analysis
- Question management with ordering

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Several TypeScript errors may appear in the console related to Supabase type definitions
   - These errors don't affect functionality and can be resolved by properly typing the database schema

2. **Role Switching Issues**
   - The application no longer relies on role switching for admin functions
   - All admin operations now use functions with built-in permission checks

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Test Admin Access**
   - Log in as an admin user
   - Navigate to the new admin interface (/new-admin)
   - Verify you can access all admin functions

2. **Test Doctor Approval**
   - Register a new user account with doctor information
   - Log in as admin and approve the doctor account
   - Log in as the approved doctor and verify access

3. **Test Question Ordering**
   - Create several questions with different categories
   - Try reordering questions within categories
   - Try moving questions between categories

## Migration Notes

If you previously used the old admin interface, you should be able to continue using it alongside the new one during transition. The new interface provides enhanced functionality but does not remove any existing capabilities.
