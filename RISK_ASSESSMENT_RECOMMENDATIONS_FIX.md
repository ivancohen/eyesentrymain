# Risk Assessment Recommendations Fix

This document outlines the fixes needed to ensure risk assessment recommendations are properly displayed in admin pages and risk assessment cards.

## Issues Identified

1. Recommendation boxes on the risk assessment admin pages are not updating when scores are shown
2. Caching issues preventing updates from being reflected immediately
3. No preview of recommendations in the admin interface

## Required Fixes

### 1. RiskAssessmentAdmin Component
- Add recommendation previews in the admin panel to show how recommendations will appear

### 2. RiskAssessmentService
- Clear cache when updating advice to ensure fresh data is always fetched
- Remove cache update code that might retain stale data

### 3. Questionnaires Component
- Force fresh data fetching when viewing risk assessments
- Add better logging for debugging recommendation matching

## Implementation Details

The implementation involves three main files:

1. `src/components/admin/RiskAssessmentAdmin.tsx`
2. `src/services/RiskAssessmentService.ts`
3. `src/pages/Questionnaires.tsx`

These changes have been applied directly to the files using the manual fix approach.
