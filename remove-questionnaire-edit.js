The following changes have been made:

1. Removed QuestionnaireEdit component import and route from App.tsx
   - Removed import of QuestionnaireEdit component
   - Removed route for "/questionnaire/edit/:id"

2. Removed Edit button and functionality from Questionnaires.tsx
   - Removed the Edit icon import
   - Removed the handleEditQuestionnaire function
   - Removed the Edit button from questionnaire cards

3. Removed updateQuestionnaire function from PatientQuestionnaireService.ts
   - Completely removed the function that allowed editing questionnaires
   - Maintained all other functionality including risk assessment

These changes ensure:
- The edit questionnaire feature is completely removed
- Users can still create new questionnaires with proper risk assessment
- Risk assessment scores are calculated and saved correctly with initial submissions

The system is now simplified to only allow questionnaire creation and viewing,
not modification, which helps maintain data integrity.
