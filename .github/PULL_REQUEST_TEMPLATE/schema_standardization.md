# Question Field Standardization PR

## Standardization Details

This PR implements standardization of the question field name to use `question` consistently across the codebase, removing any references to `question_text`.

## Changes Made

- [ ] Executed the database migration script `supabase/standardize_question_field.sql`
- [ ] Verified all question data is preserved and accessible
- [ ] Confirmed no code references to `question_text` remain
- [ ] Tested affected components (especially QuestionManager)
- [ ] Updated documentation to reflect the standardization

## Why This Change Is Needed

Previously, the codebase was inconsistent, using both `question` and `question_text` field names, which caused errors when trying to access the non-existent `question_text` column.

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Run the migration script
2. Verify existing questions can still be viewed and edited 
3. Confirm new questions can be created
4. Test question scoring functionality

## Related Documents

- See [Schema Standards](../../docs/SCHEMA_STANDARDS.md) for more information on the standardization

## Notes for Reviewers

This is a critical database schema change. Please verify that all operations involving question data continue to work as expected, especially:
- Question listing
- Question creation
- Question editing
- Question scoring
