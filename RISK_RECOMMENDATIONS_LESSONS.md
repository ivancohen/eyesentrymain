# Risk Assessment Recommendations: Investigation Report

## Investigation Summary

We thoroughly investigated the issue where risk assessment recommendations entered by administrators in the admin panel were not appearing in the doctor questionnaire views. After multiple approaches, we identified several key factors:

1. **Duplicate Data Structure**: The system maintains two parallel sets of entries:
   - Hardcoded entries with standard risk levels ('Low', 'Moderate', 'High')
   - Admin-entered entries with potentially varied risk level naming

2. **Display Logic**: The doctor questionnaire view only displays recommendations from the hardcoded entries, not the admin-entered ones.

3. **RPC Function Issues**: Attempts to create RPC functions for consistent data access faced environment-specific challenges, as seen in error logs:
   ```
   Error code: PGRST202
   Error message: Could not find the function public.get_risk_assessment_recommendations without parameters
   ```

## Approaches Attempted

1. **TypeScript Service Updates**: Modified the RiskAssessmentService.ts to use a consistent data access pattern
   - Result: Faced issues with RPC functions not existing in the database

2. **Database Triggers**: Attempted to create database triggers to sync admin-entered recommendations to hardcoded entries
   - Result: Encountered conflicts with existing database structures

3. **Direct Table Updates**: Created a simple SQL script to manually copy admin-entered recommendations to hardcoded entries
   - Result: This approach would work but requires manual execution after admin changes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dual Data Sources**: The application architecture maintains separate data streams for admin entries and doctor views, making synchronization challenging.

2. **Environment Dependencies**: The solution needs to account for existing database schema and functionality constraints.

3. **Incremental Testing**: Each component (database functions, TypeScript services, UI components) should be tested independently.

## Next Steps for Future Attempts

If revisiting this issue in the future, consider:

1. **Database Schema Analysis**: First, identify exactly how recommendations are stored and retrieved

2. **Minimal Intervention**: Target the specific point of disconnect with minimal changes

3. **Direct Table Operations**: Simple table operations are more reliable than complex database objects

4. **Code Synchronization**: If code changes are needed, ensure RiskAssessmentService, Questionnaires component, and QuestionnaireResults all handle the data consistently

## Conclusion

This investigation revealed architectural patterns that make recommendation synchronization complex. The most reliable approach would be a simplified direct update to hardcoded entries after admin changes, rather than attempting to modify the underlying code structure.
