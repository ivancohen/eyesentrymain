# Authentication System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address authentication issues in the application, particularly related to refresh tokens and profile fetching.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Refresh Token Error**: Fixed the `AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found` error by improving token refresh handling.

2. **Profile Fetching Error**: Addressed the 500 error when fetching profiles by making the login process more resilient to profile fetch failures.

3. **Account Verification Error**: Fixed the `Failed to verify account status` error by adding better error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext.tsx Improvements

- Made the login process more resilient by adding a fallback mechanism when profile fetching fails
- Enhanced the refresh token handling to better manage token refresh errors
- Improved the logout function to ensure consistent behavior even when errors occur

### 2. Login.tsx Improvements

- Added better error handling for various authentication scenarios
- Improved user feedback with more specific error messages
- Added handling for refresh token errors

### 3. New Utility Functions

Created a new `authUtils.ts` file with the following utilities:

- `refreshAuthSession()`: Safely refreshes the authentication session
- `isAuthenticated()`: Checks if a user is currently authenticated
- `safeSignOut()`: Safely signs out the user, handling any errors
- `handleAuthError()`: Provides user-friendly error messages for common authentication errors

### 4. Fix Scripts

Created scripts to help diagnose and fix authentication issues:

- `testAuthFlow.ts`: Tests the authentication flow to verify fixes
- `fix-profiles-table.js`: Checks and fixes the profiles table structure
- `fix-auth-tokens.js`: Creates a utility page to help users clear their authentication tokens

## How to Use the Fix Scripts

### Testing Authentication Flow

The `testAuthFlow.ts` script tests various authentication scenarios to ensure the fixes are working correctly.

```bash
# Install ts-node if not already installed
npm install -g ts-node

# Run the test script
npm run ts-node src/scripts/testAuthFlow.ts
```

### Fixing Profiles Table

The `fix-profiles-table.js` script checks and fixes the profiles table structure to address the 500 error when fetching profiles.

```bash
# Run the script
node fix-profiles-table.js
```

If the script cannot automatically fix the table, it will provide SQL statements that you can run in the Supabase SQL editor.

### Resetting Authentication Tokens

The `fix-auth-tokens.js` script creates a utility page that users can access to clear their authentication tokens.

```bash
# Run the script to create the utility page
node fix-auth-tokens.js

# Start your development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to /reset-auth.html in your browser
```

## Manual Steps for Users

If users are still experiencing authentication issues, they can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/reset-auth.html` page
2. Click the "Reset Authentication Tokens" button
3. Try logging in again

If the button doesn't work, they can manually clear their authentication data:

1. Open the browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
2. Go to the "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. In the left sidebar, expand "Local Storage" and select the site's domain
4. Look for items that start with `sb-` and delete them
5. Also check "Session Storage" and "Cookies" and remove any similar items
6. Refresh the page and try logging in again

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing these additional improvements to further enhance the authentication system:

1. **Session Monitoring**: Add a mechanism to monitor session health and proactively refresh tokens before they expire.

2. **Offline Support**: Implement better handling for authentication when users are offline.

3. **Error Tracking**: Add more comprehensive error tracking to identify authentication issues early.

4. **User Feedback**: Improve user feedback during authentication processes to provide clearer guidance when issues occur.

5. **Automatic Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery mechanisms for common authentication failures.
