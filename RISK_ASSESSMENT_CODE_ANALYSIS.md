# Risk Assessment Code Analysis

## Code Flow Analysis

To properly fix the risk assessment recommendations, we need to understand exactly how other working parts of the questionnaire system flow from administrator input to doctor-facing display.

### PatientQuestionnaireService Pattern

Looking at the PatientQuestionnaireService approach:

1. **Admin Input**:
   - Administrators enter questions, options, and other content through admin forms
   - This data is stored in tables like `questions` and `question_options`

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Functions like `getQuestionsWithTooltips()` retrieve this admin-entered content
   - These typically use direct table queries or RPC functions for access

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Data is transformed into specific structures expected by UI components
   - Often includes normalization, field mapping, and adding computed properties

4. **Component Rendering**:
   - Components like `QuestionnaireResults` use the transformed data for display
   - Props are passed down with the exact field names components expect

### RPC Function Pattern

Many successful parts of the system use RPC functions:

```typescript
// Typical pattern for retrieving admin-entered content
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_something_for_user', { user_id_param: user.id });
```

### Service Method Pattern

Successful service methods follow this pattern:

```typescript
async getSomething(): Promise<Something[]> {
  try {
    // Always clear cache to ensure fresh data (optional but common)
    this.cachedData = null;
    
    // Fetch from database using RPC or direct query
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .rpc('get_something')
      // or .from('table').select('*');
    
    // Handle errors properly
    if (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      return this.getFallbackData(); // Separate fallback function
    }
    
    // Transform data if needed
    const transformedData = data.map(item => ({
      // Map fields and normalize
    }));
    
    return transformedData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in getSomething:", error);
    return this.getFallbackData();
  }
}
```

## Code Issue Identification

Based on file analysis, here are the likely issues:

1. **Mismatched Pattern**: 
   - `RiskAssessmentService` is using a direct table query pattern for `risk_assessment_advice`
   - This may not match where admin actually inputs recommendations
   - Other functions use RPC functions or specific queries with security contexts

2. **Data Source Issue**:
   - Recommendations may be stored in a different table or format than expected
   - The admin interface might be saving to one place while the service looks elsewhere
   - The `risk_assessment_advice` table may not be populated by admin actions

3. **Retrieval Method Issue**:
   - `getDirectFixAdvice` appears to bypass normal data flow
   - It likely returns hardcoded values instead of admin-entered content
   - Function may be called in places where normal data flow should be used

## Data Path Investigation

To properly fix this, we need to trace:

1. **Where recommendations are entered in admin UI**:
   - Find the admin form components for risk assessment recommendations
   - Identify what service methods are called when submitting this form

2. **Where that data is stored**:
   - Which tables or storage mechanisms hold the admin-entered recommendations
   - What field names and structures are used

3. **What retrieval methods are used elsewhere**:
   - How other admin-entered content is retrieved
   - Which functions successfully bring admin content to doctor views

## Suggested Code Modifications

The following modifications would align risk assessment recommendations with the successful patterns:

1. **Update Data Source**:
   - Ensure the correct table or data source is being queried
   - This might mean switching from `risk_assessment_advice` to another table

2. **Standardize Retrieval Method**:
   - Use the same retrieval pattern (RPC or direct query) as other working parts
   - Ensure proper security context and permissions

3. **Fix Data Transformation**:
   - Map fields consistently with what UI components expect
   - Ensure risk levels are normalized the same way

4. **Update Component Integration**:
   - Make sure data flows correctly to display components
   - Check prop names and expected data structures
