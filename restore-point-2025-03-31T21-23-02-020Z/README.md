# Restore Point for Dropdown Option Reordering Fix

This restore point was created on 3/31/2025, 5:23:02 PM before implementing the dropdown option reordering fix.

## Contents

- `QuestionService.ts`: Backup of the original service file
- `QuestionFormManager.tsx`: Backup of the original component file
- `dropdown_options_backup.json`: Backup of all dropdown options in the database
- `questions_backup.json`: Backup of questions with dropdown options
- `restore.js`: Script to restore the code and data to this point

## How to Restore

If you need to roll back the changes, run:

```
node restore-point-2025-03-31T21-23-02-020Z/restore.js
```

This will:
1. Restore the original code files
2. Restore the database to its previous state

## After Restoring

After restoring, you'll need to:
1. Restart your development server
2. Verify that the application is working as it was before the fix

## Notes

- The restore process will delete all current dropdown options and replace them with the backed-up data
- Any changes made to the code files after this restore point was created will be lost when restoring
